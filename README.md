This repo is about a simple blog for begginers. (I am a begginer)<br/>
The sample.html file contains a simple sample html for blogging that you can copy and edit.<br/>
Now, open any word processor and 'replace all' 'date' text with the title of blog and 'replace all' 'content' with the content you want to type.<br/>
The <pre><b> and </b></pre> tags contain green bold format.<br/>
The <pre><i> and </i></pre> tags contain bigger size of text with italics style.
Replace the 'I am Deepam Makwana' with your name.

Contact me to know how I made this.
